Description: Offers a comprehensive approach for analysing stratified 2x2 contingency tables. It facilitates the calculation of odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and conducts chi-squared tests, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests, and Breslow-Day-Tarone tests. The package is particularly useful in fields like epidemiology and social sciences where stratified analysis is essential. The package also provides interpretative insights into the results, aiding in the understanding of complex statistical outcomes.
